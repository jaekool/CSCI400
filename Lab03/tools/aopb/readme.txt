= Introduction =

Break passwords and unlock documents instead of performing lengthy password recovery. Advanced Office Password Breaker unlocks password-protected Microsoft Word documents and Excel spreadsheets within a guaranteed timeframe instead of attacking and recovering the complex passwords. Need the documents unlocked faster? Speed up the recovery by using multi-processor or multi-core systems or several computers and get your data back in almost no time.


= Requirements =

- Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008
- about one megabyte of free space on hard disk (8 gigabytes for Enterprise version; 8Gb USB flash drive recommended)


= Known bugs and limitations =

The program does NOT work with the following files:

- Microsoft Word/Excel 95 or older;
- Microsoft Word/Excel 97/2000 with French regional settings;
- Microsoft Word/Excel 97/2000/XP with any passwords other than "open" ones;
- Microsoft Word/Excel XP/2002 with new CSP protection;
- Microsoft Word/Excel 2007.

All such files are supported by Advanced Office Password Recovery (AOPPR) which is available at:

On Office 97/2000/XP/2003/2007 files with 'open' password, however, AOPR can run only brute-force and dictionary attacks, but they'll fail is password is long enough and well selected.
