RainbowCrack 1.4 readme

Introduction
--------------------------------
RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin's faster time-memory trade-off technique.
It cracks hashes with rainbow tables.

Features:
- Full time-memory tradeoff tool suites, including rainbow table generation, sort, conversion and lookup
- Support rainbow table of any hash algorithm
- Support rainbow table of any charset
- Support rainbow table in raw file format (.rt) and compact file format (.rtc)
- Computation on multi-core processor support
- Computation on GPU (via NVIDIA CUDA technology) support (not freely available)
- Computation on multi-GPU (via NVIDIA CUDA technology) support (not freely available)
- Runs on Windows XP 32-bit and Windows Vista 32-bit
- Command line user interface

System Requirements
--------------------------------
Operating System:	any 32-bit version of Windows
Memory:				at least 256MB

Documentation
--------------------------------
Documentation of RainbowCrack 1.4 software is available at http://project-rainbowcrack.com/.

Version History
--------------------------------
Changes in version 1.4
- New compact rainbow table file format (.rtc) reduce rainbow table size by 50% to 56.25%
- New rt2rtc utility convert rainbow table from raw file format (.rt) to compact file format (.rtc)
- New rtc2rt utility convert rainbow table from compact file format (.rtc) to raw file format (.rt)
- The rcrack/rcrack_cuda program support both .rt and .rtc rainbow table file format
- Conversion from non-perfect to perfect rainbow table is supported by rt2rtc utility

Changes in version 1.3
- Multicore processor support 
  Earlier versions will only use one core on a multicore processor system.
- Overlapped harddisk read and computation
  RainbowCrack 1.3 can do computation and load rainbow tables from harddisk concurrently.
- Improved hash algorithm performance of NTLM and MD5
- Fully backward compatible with existing rainbow tables generated by earlier versions of RainbowCrack
  RainbowCrack 1.3 use same rainbow table format as earlier versions.
- Other enhancements

Changes in version 1.2
- Multiple hash algorithms support
- Configurable plaintext length
- LanManager password case correction

Changes in version 1.1
- Custom charset support

Changes in version 1.01
- Bugfix

Changes in version 1.0
- Initial release
