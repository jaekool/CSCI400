INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

No installation necessary, just put the binary in whatever 
location you like and run it.  

---------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone is welcome to compile for your own system.  If you 
can make a binary which beats the performance of one of the 
pre-compiled versions for a particular architecture, I'd 
love to hear about it!


GCC 32 bit OS
=============
make x86 [GMPECM=1] [BLOCK=64] [PROFILE=1] [TIMING=1]

GCC 64 bit OS
=============
make x86_64 [GMPECM=1] [BLOCK=64] [PROFILE=1] [TIMING=1]

optionally enable the p+1, p-1, and ecm factoring routines
to utilize GMPECM libraries by setting GMPECM=1 during make.
This will require the makefile to be edited to point to the
location of your gmp and gmpecm libraries and include files.

optionally enable 64k sieve block sizes by setting BLOCK=64 
during make.  this sets the size of the sieve interval during
siqs, mpqs, pqs, and the sieve of eratosthenes.  in general
the sieve block size should match the L1 data cache size of your
CPU.  64k blocksizes are faster for AMD64 systems 
(and possibly others).

optionally enable gcc profiling by setting PROFILE=1 during 
make.  this produces profiling information when run and thus
slows down the program.  profiling information can then be
viewed using, for example, gprof.

optionally enable more detailed timing during SIQS by setting
TIMING=1 during make.  This will slightly slow down siqs.

WINDOWS MS Visual Studio Express Edition 2008
=============

Build files are available for MSVC EE2008.  The directory 
structure is important for these builds, especially if GMPECM
support is desired.  The build files expect to see an mpir
and gmp-ecm folder at the same level as the yafu folder in the
directory tree, with the following structure:

gmp-ecm
	ecm.h
	config.h
	build.vc9
		Win32
			Release
				ecm.lib
		x64
			Release
				ecm.lib
mpir
	gmp.h
	config.h
	gmp-mparam.h
	mpir.h
	build.vc9
		Win32
			Release
				mpir.lib
		x64
			Release
				mpir.lib
				
yafu
	build.vc9
		...
		
The mpir and gmp-ecm libraries will need to be build
separately, for either Win32 or x64 targets.  To change the 
target for a yafu build, within MSVC select 
Build -> Configuration Manger
then in the Active Solution Platform pulldown choose x64 or 
Win32.

Other platforms
=============
If you build yafu on other platforms or using other IDE's or
compilers, please let me know about it.



---------------------------------------------------------------
HELP INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

Detailed (somewhat) documentation is available in docfile.txt, 
which can be viewed during a yafu session by typing 'help'

In you want to see the docfile from within the code, it needs 
to be in the same directory as the executable.

MISC INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a fun test case for factor(), which uses many of the 
algorithms in yafu
